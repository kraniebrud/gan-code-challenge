# GAN code challenge

## Running it

There are 2 ways to try the challenge, but first `npm install` 

1. start server and then start the challenge
    * `npm run start-server` the server will start
    *  in a new terminal window `npm run start-challenge`
2. spin way. *this approach  is considered abit "7-9-13"* 
    * `npm run spin` it will start server when server is ready it should run the challenge and print to out

## Notes

I decided to keep it as slim as possible, leaving out tests, error handling, code style convention, schema etc. Focusing mainly on having the challenge to run all the way to the end with clear code. Please note that the completion is *not* what I would call production ready!

.. I mistyped company name for the repo, sorry!
